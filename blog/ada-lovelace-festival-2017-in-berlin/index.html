		<p>The last week I have attended Ada Lovelace Festival that occurred on 19-20 October 2017. The aim of the event to connect women in computing and technology.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I was a bit too late for the keynote, because I had a lecture at the university. However, I joined the conference, and after registration, I got my bag with sponsors gifts.</p>

<p>For example, a pen and a paper notebook from the WirtschaftsWoche, and a small car model and candies from Porsche. I was a quite pleased. Of course, I also grabbed a few relevant stickers for my laptop.</p>

<p>Below, I would like to list the talks and a workshop that I have found pretty inspiring for me as a woman in tech.</p>

<p>The first speech <code>Talent: The tools we need to build a digital nation of signification</code> by Jacqueline de Rojas, techUK was about the importance of smart and intelligent people in the tech industry.</p>

<p>The future turns digital. That means people keep up with the times, taking into consideration all the software industry aspects.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/images/ada-lovelace-1.jpg" alt="Photo-1" /></p>

<p>The next workshop, that gave me valuable tips and pointed out some ways how to grow your brand called <code>To be in the 1st row: Build your own brand</code> by Regina Mehler, WOMEN SPEAKER FOUNDATION.</p>

<p>The speaker showed us the importance of networking, communication, and negotiation with top-brass people at occasional meetings, using examples from their career. The workshop finished with a practical session between participants.</p>

<p>As a web developer, I couldn&rsquo;t pass the talk <code>How to improve our technical decision-making skills</code> by Duana Stanley, Clue. All developers know that the core skill of problem-solving is to find useful information quickly and to be able to make a decision based on the reliable information and requirements.</p>

<p>Firstly, the speaker defined what a right technical decision is. Such decision takes context into account. Then speaker has described the process in which developers should:</p>

<ul>
<li>understand the decision,</li>
<li>check their emotions,</li>
<li>list and evaluate options,</li>
<li>build consensus and</li>
<li>sleep on it.</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point, Iâ€™m going to finish the post. I have tried to share my impression from the Ada Lovelace Festival 2017 in Berlin with you, dear Techmakers. I hope you enjoyed the highlights of the event from my point of view.</p>

<p>Wish you a great week and new achievements.</p>
