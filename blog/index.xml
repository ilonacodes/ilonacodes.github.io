Most people want to develop self-awareness. Whether we are managers, entrepreneurs, or aspiring software engineers, the more knowledge we have of our strength and weaknesses, the easier life becomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

Soft skills are as critical as technical skills for a software engineer.
No one works in isolation. Each person has to deal with teammates, colleagues, managers, etc. Therefore team interpersonal skills are essential too. Soft skills include things like good communication, honesty, teamwork, integrity, organization, empathy, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

After talking to women in the IT industry, it&amp;rsquo;s clear that the reason they leave their previous companies that they do not like the culture of their work, and do not feel like they have enough support to change it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is the importance of committing mistakes?</title>

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

It is a well-known fact that all human beings are different and unique in their ways. However, no matter how unique and different we are from one another, one thing which remains the same between all of us is our innate nature to commit mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

Success is an entity that all human beings want and wish to achieve. It could be attaining success in the workplace, in business, in a relationship, in family matters, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

Everyone has this time in life when they feel imperfect and emotionally exhausted. We continuously doubt ourselves, every single day no matter what happens. Moreover, even successful people have gone through this feeling in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

There are a lot of different and efficient ways how to improve web app development speed while implementing and testing new features. One of them is to be able to reuse UI components.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

Nowadays there are a lot of UI frameworks for React like Bootstrap, UIKit, Semantic UI and so on. Depending on the project complexity and requirements, you decide which front-end framework would be used because the main reason is to ease your development process.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

The last days I am spending time on learning &lt;a href=&#34;https://graphql.org/&#34;&gt;GraphQL&lt;/a&gt; and how its clients communicate between frontend and backend application parts.&lt;/p&gt;

After &lt;strong&gt;React Hooks&lt;/strong&gt; introduction at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpw9EHDh2bM&#34;&gt;React Conf October 2018&lt;/a&gt; I decided to learn this approach how to use state and side-effects in React functional components.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

There are many tools available for designers to create beautiful user interfaces and user experiences. And today I want to share another approach on how to build interactive design prototypes with ReactJS and why.&lt;/p&gt;

In this post, I explain how you can find any user on GitHub through GitHub API using ReactJS, Redux, Saga, Axios, and Formik.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do we need to use this technology stack? Here is the short description:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Should We Create Conversational Experiences For Our Applications?</title>

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These days, we are bridging the communication gap between human and computer. The next big thing is a conversational interface — the era of natural language processing. To highlight the point, nowadays there are two kinds of a conversational interface — virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa) and chatbots (like Slackbot, Telegram), which through “human” experience help end user to complete the specific task.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When I was learning React there were a couple things that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t clearly understand and one of them was &lt;strong&gt;children prop&lt;/strong&gt;. That is until I faced the problem similar to the following one.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Simple Image Carousel with React</title>

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here we are! Due to my master thesis at the university, one of the requirements is the implementation of an interactive mockup for the university WebTV platform. So, I decided to make it with React.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Simple State Machine with Redux</title>

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The last days I am working on the project, which should include the state machine. Implementing this project with React, I decided to use the Redux framework to manage state in my React application. Moreover, thanks to redux store we can debug data (in one place) easily.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Formik With React</title>

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

The way, how I try to understand the purpose of any framework is to use it and compare with the already implemented no-framework solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, most of us, at first hear about a new library from tech media portals or from tech-dev influencers or from conferences/meetups or from coworkers, etc. then we are going to check out the source of it whether it is a software or open-source product. In the end, we are playing with it and trying to apply it to the existing product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

From the title of the post, you understand that I am not only going to explain how to implement a traditional TODO-List with React, but also show you how I am applying &lt;a href=&#34;https://emotion.sh/&#34;&gt;emotion-js&lt;/a&gt; for this mini-project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last 2-3 months I have been following a low-carb meal plan, which basically means that I remove only the products with lots of carbs from my ration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choosing a low-carb diet is the same as cutting out alcohol, cigarettes, etc. The pros: you are no longer an addict to cheap carbs and sugar for your energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know most people cannot work productively at home. Someone finds it difficult to organize themselves. Others can’t make the right schedule to work at home. For others, the work environment at home (or a cafe) is just not optimized for work in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, now I want to describe the ideal setup that inspires me to be productive work at home. Find my most essential tips below on how to set up a productive home office:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you know or notice, I always put in my posts information or results which I have experienced on my own. And frankly, it happens almost every day. Yes, I do love to learn new things and then share them with you, my readers, about what I actually have discovered. However, this post is an exception, because it’s not about tech or UX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? I explain that below.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Creating Floating Label/Placeholder for Input with React</title>

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To make the application fancy, front-end web developers usually visualize it using animations or other effects. And now I am going to explain one of the methods how to apply the most famous floating label effect to the input field with React.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays any viable product pursues the goal to grow globally. That means the successful online product is supposed to have minimum two language locales. One of them is english as an international language, and the other one depends on the spoken language of the target audience (usually domestic).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To understand the business goals is just as important as understanding user needs. Without that, the chances of creating useful and viable products are low. Here is why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From the title, you already guessed that I am going to speak about the design of the product, app or website that starts with content first.
In my opinion, there are many advantages to applying the content first approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you really want to get better at color, start studying it.
Picking the right colors is something that might seem easy at first. And when you are starting down a color wheel, you are going to wish you had some information on what you are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Hi everyone! It&amp;rsquo;s time for a new post.
What we do (I mean front-end web developers) isn&amp;rsquo;t all that unique. Often we face the problem that seems easy to solve. However, sometimes we spend hours on finding the solution.
In this case, I wanted to change the opacity of the app teaser background color and don&amp;rsquo;t change the opacity of links. I have tried some silly approaches that seemed logical to me, and they all have failed.</description>

      <description>Happy Friday, my readers!
As a front-end web developer, I am also interested in UI/UX design, and that is why I’ve decided me to do a UI/UX research using Aristotle’s Seven Elements of Storytelling framework.
It is notably practical, and many designers, web developers, will benefit from applying this method for creating user-friendly interfaces.
In my opinion, it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand the users and to make it easier for them to use apps.</description>

      <description>Hey there, that’s me again and a new post from me!
Lately, I worked on the project that generates live documentation of the front-end components for apps built with create-react-app, and this UI development environment is called Storybook.
What is the significant purpose for using this tool?
First of all, it helps to avoid code duplications and to make it easy to know which components there are already, what they are doing and how they are being used.</description>

      <description>Hi, everyone! How is your weekend going?
As you know, I prefer learning to code by doing things. So, the last feature I have implemented for the app is the reading of the content from the uploaded (local) .csv file from the user.
To do so without a server or any back-end—is a challenge.
To make things work properly in React+Redux, I have created the following component:
const ImportFromFileBodyComponent = () =&amp;gt; { let fileReader; const handleFileRead = (e) =&amp;gt; { const content = fileReader.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s front-end shorts, and I am trying to highlight the most important information. Thus, just let’s have a look at the significant code snippets with explanations:
I have created the action:

      <description>Today I am going to tell you how to get JSON data from the Rest-API to UI using React+Redux frameworks.
In my case, the task looks like:
I have a URL, for example: https://api.com/v1/expenses/ which will give the following JSON data, and I want to get this data in my UI.
To solve this task, I decided to use JavaScript’s fetch method. So in this way, I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t rely on any external libraries (given my target browsers are remotely up-to-date).</description>

      <description>Hi, everyone! How is your week going?
Yesterday I worked with the web application written on React + Redux and had had some problem with the react-router-redux library. In short, the push method (using for navigation outside of components) didn&amp;rsquo;t work.
Firstly, I have tried to set the Route component in the &amp;ldquo;traditional&amp;rdquo; way such as with react-router library. That might get the history props. Unfortunately, that also didn&amp;rsquo;t work. Because of Redux framework.</description>

Recently there are a lot of sites, which have featured with parallax scrolling effect, that represents them in more interactive &amp;ldquo;professionally-made&amp;rdquo; way.
This fact made me recreate the effect using Vanilla JavaScript, an example of which you can see below.
Let&amp;rsquo;s a look at the implementation of parallax effect in Vanilla JavaScript.
I have used a &amp;lsquo;scroll&amp;rsquo; event on browser &amp;lsquo;window,&amp;rsquo; and retrieved the number of pixels the document is currently scrolled along the vertical axis from &amp;lsquo;window.</description>

The last days I had to work with Javascript and jQuery a lot apart from React and spent much time on creating templates. As you know, nowadays modern web pages include animated scrolling, which makes any site look professional and more elegant (instead of simple link element reference in HTML5).</description>

As you noticed, I post a new blog post about the development of an interactive ToDo list regularly, every five days. But today I am going to tell you about the international IT-conference Codemotion, that I have attended on 12-13. October in Berlin.
There were a lot of informative and motivational topics, that can inspire everyone, who are interested or work in IT-branch.

And today I would like to start the topic about persisting the data and restoring it after refreshing the page or starting a new session on the local machine with React+Redux.
Changing into the my-daily-todos project, then to src folder where you find index.js. Here we store all the app’s state in the store variable.</description>

      <description>The most valuable feature set for our Daily ToDo is already done. Today we are going to make an app more functional, separating tasks by categories. We want to be able to categorize task by typing # and category after its title.
For example: practice a coding kata #programming.
As always, we start with the simple user story and the acceptance criteria:
As Bob I want to categorize tasks by adding tag into input So I see which task belongs to which category ## Acceptance Criteria Given there are no tasks And I am on dashboard screen When I finish inputting a new task title And choose the category (tag) for a task And press Enter Then I see the categorized task by tag on the dashboard screen Tag examples: Programming, Sport, Languages, University, Reading, Routine  If you are a new reader of the tutorial series and don&amp;rsquo;t understand what is going on at the moment, then just check the previous posts starting with React For Very Very Beginners</description>

      <description>Today we are going to implement the second feature for our app. If you are a new reader, then I highly recommend you to check my earlier blog posts here, where we started our learning journey in React+Redux, refer to the posts complete previous steps and continue with us to develop an interactive ToDo List from here.
As you guess from the blog title, the next feature called Complete a task.</description>

      <description>Hi, everyone! I guess you are pretty encouraged to start coding our app. Just to remind: it will be an interactive daily ToDo List. Today I am going to explain: what is a user story? Why do we need to write it before implementing a feature? How will we organize and structure an app? What is, actually, a new feature?
Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the first question. In my opinion, user stories are efficient things.</description>

      <description>As I promised in my previous post, today I am going to tell you about Redux, why and how we need to use them in common. Let me introduce React+Redux co-working through the simple input change that should render Hello, {any name / text}! at the end and manage by redux states.
Redux? What is it? Redux is a predictable state container for managing both UI-state and data-state in JavaScript applications.</description>

      <description>The biggest challenge for beginners not only in front end development but also in the whole web development world is to find the answer to the question: How / Where should I start to learn web development? Some of these questions I have already received via private messages on social networks, and that encouraged me to create a series of small posts to write and complete the first app using JS (ECMA6) with React-Redux frameworks on which technologies I specialize.</description>

      <description>Today I started doing backend part for my project. It will be written in Ruby language and using Sinatra framework.
This post is directed at readers that have little experiences to understand the aim of REST API for a product development.
Coming back to my project, I had to implement search and preview functionalities. I used a .txt file to describe the REST API precisely and go through it step by step.</description>

      <description>Hi there!
There are a lot of ways how to implement a sticky footer on the page that will always remain at a fixed position on the screen no matter whether the user scroll or not. It will be visible all the time at that specific place (often on bottom).
I would like to share my way how I added the sticky footer on my site.
Firstly, I added two separated  tags inside the body in index.</description>

      <description>Hi there!
I have worked on my project using a React-Redux architecture with React-Router for navigation. I have implemented forms for adding and editing resources. I have observed weird behavior:
 Add new resource with a description: &amp;ldquo;Hello World!&amp;rdquo; Start editing another resource with a description: &amp;ldquo;My new comment&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; Input for description contains a previous value: &amp;ldquo;Hello World!&amp;rdquo;  I was expecting to see the current description of the resource: &amp;ldquo;My new comment&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;, not the value from the previous form.</description>

      <description>Hi, everyone!
I am very happy to welcome you on my blog. A couple of days ago I started creating my new project (that I will have presented to you in a couple of weeks). And I have faced the following problem: I wanted to build a page with Sign Up form, and this page doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any other content. In that case, it made a lot of sense to center the form, both horizontally and vertically.</description>
