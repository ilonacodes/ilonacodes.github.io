<h3>1. Overview</h3>
<p>There are many ways of discovering Berlin: with a travel guide or an informative website or on the spot with a practical app. The Berlin Wall Quiz is an interactive app which helps users to get more information or learn the history and interesting facts about the Berlin Wall. Photos, audio, and video clips, texts are presented in historical chronology. At the end of the every chronological time slot, there is an opportunity to start a quiz and see results after the completion.
