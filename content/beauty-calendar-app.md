<h3>1. Overview</h3>
<p>Considering so many women now use beauty treatment services it seems worth to implement the app that allows managing appointments for beauty care procedures by categories. Choose a date, create a new beauty appointment relevant to the beauty category, and you will not be confused anymore with the uncategorized beauty appointment list.</p>
<h3>2. Process</h3>
<p>On the top place, the product strategy took into account to create MVP model with the primary feature set I was working on. The requested features were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating beauty appointments</li>
<li>Categorizing beauty appointments</li>
<li>Deleting beauty appointments</li>
<li>Integrating date picker view</li>
<li>Making the list of beauty appointments</li>
<li>Sending automatic notifications to remind the user about the upcoming appointment</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Research & Personas</h3>
<p>I conducted competitive analysis research on similar products that were already out on the international market. I found many apps did not offer the same feature set in one place such as I have implemented, and it could be something unique that would stand out.</p>
<p>Why users need this kind of app?</p>
<ul>
<li>The easy using mobile platform for managing lots of beauty appointments by categories</li>
<li>Sending notifications in short before the beauty appointment</li>
<li>Supporting user-friendly interface</li>
</ul>
<p>What are the business expectations?</p>
<ul>
<li>Collaborating with beauty salons or studios in future</li>
<li>Running ads after increasing user base</li>
</ul>
