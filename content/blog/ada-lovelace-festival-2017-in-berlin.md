The last week I have attended Ada Lovelace Festival that occurred on 19-20 October 2017. The aim of the event to connect women in computing and technology.

Unfortunately, I was a bit too late for the keynote, because I had a lecture at the university. However, I joined the conference, and after registration, I got my bag with sponsors gifts.

For example, a pen and a paper notebook from the WirtschaftsWoche, and a small car model and candies from Porsche. I was a quite pleased. Of course, I also grabbed a few relevant stickers for my laptop.

Below, I would like to list the talks and a workshop that I have found pretty inspiring for me as a woman in tech.

The first speech `Talent: The tools we need to build a digital nation of signification` by Jacqueline de Rojas, techUK was about the importance of smart and intelligent people in the tech industry.

The future turns digital. That means people keep up with the times, taking into consideration all the software industry aspects.

The next workshop, that gave me valuable tips and pointed out some ways how to grow your brand called `To be in the 1st row: Build your own brand` by Regina Mehler, WOMEN SPEAKER FOUNDATION.

The speaker showed us the importance of networking, communication, and negotiation with top-brass people at occasional meetings, using examples from their career. The workshop finished with a practical session between participants.

As a web developer, I couldn't pass the talk `How to improve our technical decision-making skills` by Duana Stanley, Clue. All developers know that the core skill of problem-solving is to find useful information quickly and to be able to make a decision based on the reliable information and requirements.

Firstly, the speaker defined what a right technical decision is. Such decision takes context into account. Then speaker has described the process in which developers should:

- understand the decision,
- check their emotions,
- list and evaluate options,
- build consensus and
- sleep on it.

At this point, Iâ€™m going to finish the post. I have tried to share my impression from the Ada Lovelace Festival 2017 in Berlin with you, dear Techmakers. I hope you enjoyed the highlights of the event from my point of view.

Wish you a great week and new achievements.
