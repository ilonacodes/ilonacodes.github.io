If you really want to get better at color, start studying it.
Picking the right colors is something that might seem easy at first. And when you are starting down a color wheel, you are going to wish you had some information on what you are looking for.

One might have an aesthetic taste for colors naturally. That would make things simpler.

But most people donâ€™t.

It could take years to learn and master color combinations through experience.

Thatâ€™s why I want to share my approach how to choose right colors and color schemes.

1. **Start in black and white**
Step by step you can make some elements grey and then add one color at a time.
2. **The less is more**
Donâ€™t ever choose more than two colours unless you really have a good reason to do that.
3. **Donâ€™t make things worse**
Keep your text black and grey, and your background white until you feel sure to change them, without any doubts. And when you choose a background color other than white / very light grey, you better have a good reason for that.
4. **Copy but not paste**
I find it right to start to copy other sites that look good. If you have already got most of the design nailed, then you wonâ€™t be plagiarizing by just imitating the color scheme of another site.
One of the essential aspects of using colors in website design is that they have the power to communicate with people:

As you start approaching color the same way as usability, youâ€™ll begin to see that it becomes a critical part of planning your designs. That actually makes it easier to narrow down the appropriate choices at the end.
