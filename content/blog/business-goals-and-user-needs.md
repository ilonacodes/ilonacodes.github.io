To understand the business goals is just as important as understanding user needs. Without that, the chances of creating useful and viable products are low. Here is why.

<!--more-->

The business pays for the product. The more value the product brings to the company, the higher the probability that a product will be funded and supported for a long term.

Good, you have created something that user really like to use, but at the same time it also has no business value to demonstrate, what do you think, how long this product will survive? If the business goals are not met, then the company (potentially) won’t be able to sustain itself.

That’s why the goal is to find that “intersection” between business goals, user needs and technical constraints, which is called UX.

An example pop-up with the sign-up form.

While the user is already doing something in the app and has a particular goal in mind, unquestionably no one wants to interrupt them by showing a pop-up to sign up for newsletters, for example. But what about the business objectives that supposed to get the user email address?

On the one hand, we want to help the user to accomplish their goals, on the other hand, we want also satisfy the business requirements.

So, we agreed that the pop-up with the sign-up form will happen. And, what is the right solution now?

After observing how people interact with pop-ups using any app, I understood that this feature should also be designed in a right — clear — way, to balance user and business requirements and based on UX.

Perhaps, the way how I see the right solution should be applied to it, not the best one to achieve the “business-user” goal, and it should be tested again and again to figure out the best way.

That’s it. 🙂
