As you know or notice, I always put in my posts information or results which I have experienced on my own. And frankly, it happens almost every day. Yes, I do love to learn new things and then share them with you, my readers, about what I actually have discovered. However, this post is an exception, because it’s not about tech or UX.

Why? I explain that below.

I am really, truly happy to receive emails from you, my readers! You make me feel that I am doing the right and useful thing. I appreciate it. Thank you!

However, sometimes I get some emails, that actually I don’t know how to answer. Reading them, I feel that the person would like to ask me some question, but unfortunately, I don’t get the point what’s the real purpose of it at the end.

And, it motivated me to share my thoughts via this post. Showing how it seems for me would be nice to start an email conversation. Especially if you never contacted the other person.

Firstly, the first email shouldn’t be so long.

2-3 sentences would be enough to introduce yourself and highlight the purpose of the email. Moreover, the receiver would understand your point immediately.

Imagine how intimidating it feels to receive the wall of text from somebody you don’t even know…

Secondly, don’t forget about the action questions.

After you have introduced yourself, and have expressed your interest in collaborating with the other person, now it is time to move to the action item — to ask a question or make a request.

As a result, you will see how it is easier to continue corresponding if both sides know already what is going on.

Next, be honest and transparent with your words.

Yeah, it’s so important. Nobody likes to be deceived not only in real life but also in the email conversation. If you have a specific offer, then try to express it most transparently and coherently possible. It also helps to avoid misunderstanding and create trust between people.

Last but not least, alternatives.

If you think that the offer includes not that many advantages to the other side and couldn’t be collaborated as you want, then the next sentence should be about the alternatives. There is always a way to negotiate almost any situation. If the other participant saw more options, it would be easier to reach a consensus and agree on the offer.

(don’t include too many alternatives to avoid the analysis paralysis.

And more, and more…

If this email is crucial for you, communicate this in the last sentence of your message. This way, you are informing that it would be great to get the answer ASAP.

That’s it Here I have described the right way how to approach the email conversation from my perspective, and about what kind of structure I would be happy to receive and read.

Thank you for reading!

Feel free to share your thoughts about how the practical emailing should look like or how you conduct your email conversations. As you know, you can reach me by email, Twitter, or Instagram.

Cheers,
