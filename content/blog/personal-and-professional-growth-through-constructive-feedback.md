If you are constantly questioning yourself about your personal and professional growth that means you are already off to a great start!

<!--more-->

If you are constantly questioning yourself about your personal and professional growth that means you are already off to a great start!

We all have concerns about ourselves. Sometimes, we cannot evaluate our current state of personal and professional development. Either we overestimate or underestimate our progress. And it's normal because we are always seeking balance in life.

A great software engineer is a good problem-solver and a good team-player, who will generously share their knowledge and help other software developers improve themselves. They value team achievement over personal achievement which means they help teammates when they stuck and take criticism as well. There are a lot of ways to improve your personal and professional growth as a software engineer.

And the most important one is an opportunity to receive constructive feedback.


## Feedback from Team

I have been working in a cross-functional team by following scrum methodology. Every two weeks we run a sprint retrospective in "Start-Stop-Continue" format.

The idea behind this format is that the team will have the chance to recognize the achievements and mistakes we made during the sprint.

Usually, we collectively answer the questions: What should we start/continue/stop doing in the next sprints?

In these cases, first, it is about bad habits that should be just broken (STOP) or good ideas that we didn't follow up to, whereas we should have (START). This format is also about reaching success, confirming patterns and behaviors that led to good results (CONTINUE).


## Feedback from Dev Team

Despite that software engineers write code, read the code of others, they also get constructive feedback on their code from a team. It's impossible to know everything and predict all the crucial consequences of the code contribution for the product. Each time it may be missed something.

Moreover, code contributors can learn from a provided code review, because it's more about catching and fixing errors if it does right, then it strengthens the skills and increases the knowledge of the development team.

There is absolutely no shame in accepting suggestions from other team members to improve code quality. And of course, offering the same when you are acting as a reviewer. Because together we make things better than we could do it on our own.


## Feedback from Manager

Good team leaders/managers should understand and know the current mental state, priorities, and concerns of team members. The best opportunity for that is a biweekly one-on-one feedback session with everyone from a team. During this meeting, a team leader/manager can not only understand the problems of the person but also identify the problems in a team and help a team to overcome them.

Indeed, gathering feedback about team performance, encouraging openness and honesty, building trust is these things that will pay off later as a result. Instead of protecting themselves and their interests, a team will focus on improving team collaboration, solving causing problems together, productivity and attaining common goals.

I am lucky to work at [Zenjob](https://www.zenjob.de/) where I can grow personally and professionally through teamwork, ongoing feedbacks, the flat hierarchy between employees and managers, also have flexible hours and a lot of learning opportunities.
