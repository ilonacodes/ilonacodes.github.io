The last 2-3 months I have been following a low-carb meal plan, which basically means that I remove only the products with lots of carbs from my ration.

Choosing a low-carb diet is the same as cutting out alcohol, cigarettes, etc. The pros: you are no longer an addict to cheap carbs and sugar for your energy.

The first days I spent dreaming about chocolate even while having conversations with others üòÖ. Yeah, I remember the times when I imagined a massive bar of chocolate with hazelnuts haha üòÇ.

That‚Äôs how bad it was.

On top of that, I have been going more for seasonal and organic products, as well as drinking more water and trying to listen to my body cravings.

## The body will rebel, just give it some time
What I have found is that there could be all these strict meal plans done for you, but sometimes our body knows better what it needs. The body will rebel a bit, like in my case with chocolate üç´. But give it a week to soak in the change and eventually it will start going along.

I had a few intense days when I felt sick just thinking about dinner for some reason (perhaps, because of the hot summer days in Berlin) so I would go for a natural yogurt with berries instead. And listening to that worked well.

Around 3 months in:
- I have more energy than I had in a while;
- All the sugar cravings are long gone;
- I am getting close to my perfect weight (not that it was a goal);
- I have learned many healthier alternatives to bad carbs;
- I am getting to know better my body and its rhythm, and what kind of products work well for me and when.

And of course, I feel comfortable in my own body - which is the biggest win of all.

## Not all carbs are bad
I just really want to say, that good carbs are not the enemy. Unfortunately, a lot of girls might get the message wrong and fear all sorts of carbs, when in reality the right carbs are the fuel that our brain runs on.

In short, instead of ‚Äúalternatives to carbs‚Äù I would say: eat more unrefined and complex carbs because it‚Äôs important to get all the nutrients needed. Absolutely, avoid refined carbs, and allow yourself a few simple carbs (like one fruit a day).

I try not to exceed 120-150g of carbs a day, which seems to be enough to have good carbs included in the daily food and works well for me.

## Conclusion
This post is based on my own experience, that helps me balance my nutrition in everyday life. I am also interested in reading about your healthy nutrition habits for a better and productive life.

Thank you for reading! üëè
