These days, we are bridging the communication gap between human and computer. The next big thing is a conversational interface — the era of natural language processing. To highlight the point, nowadays there are two kinds of a conversational interface — virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa) and chatbots (like Slackbot, Telegram), which through “human” experience help end user to complete the specific task.

I firmly believe it’s future of web and frontend applications. So, today I want to tell you about chatbot-like experience based on web sign up form.

And answering the question: **WHY** should we create conversational experiences for our applications?

- **Replacing time-consuming long form**

Almost every online product includes not only one, sometimes at least a few web forms that the user has to fill to get what they want from the product.

The worst situation if the form is long. At first sight, the user is already unmotivated to proceed within and spend time on it.

So, the conversational form makes the process more interesting, exciting, and not that boring. Moreover, it provides a more “human” experience through pre-defined message templates.

- **Supporting cross-platform/cross-app integration**

Such a beautiful thing, being able to apply the conversational form to other projects. No matter what the architecture your project already has, a chatbot-like form could be used as a library and integrated quickly into existing project structure.

- **Creating smart scenarios based on user’s answers**

To help the user accomplish their goals, notably, filling the long web form. To optimize the user-flow in such way, that it’ll convince the user to stay with the form until the end.

- **Prioritizing input-data through target questions**

Through directly chatting with the user collect the required data. For example, by using CTA (“call-to-action”) buttons, which contains optional choices for some interactions. As a result, the user should only click on the specific button to choose their option.

**Instead of showing a bunch of questions in the long web form to your user, choose a natural conversational approach with an enjoyable chat for the user.**
