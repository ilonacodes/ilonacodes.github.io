Here we are! Due to my master thesis at the university, one of the requirements is the implementation of an interactive mockup for the university WebTV platform. So, I decided to make it with React.

<!--more-->

Working with the video lists filtered by category encouraged me to use **nuka-carousel**. Though, I used it for one of the cases to complete the task. [Here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/nuka-carousel) you can have a look closer at the library and figure out how it works.

For another case, because of specific requirements, I needed to code the **custom carousel**. And now I am going to share the outcome solution.

I hope you already guessed to set up a new React application from the [official tutorial](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).

The next step is to create a new class React component, in my case it is `<Videos />`. Which we are going to import and pass into render-component `<App />`:

```javascript
// App.js

import React, { Component } from 'react';
import {Videos} from './Videos';
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <Videos />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
export default App;
```

I will skip the styling part and just present the implementation of the logical part, so letâ€™s see what the `<Videos />` component looks like:

```javascript
// Videos.js

import React from 'react';
import arrowRight from './img/arrow-right.svg';
import arrowLeft from './img/arrow-left.svg';
export class Videos extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = {
     // holding the current index for the image that has to be rendered at each time on the screen
     currentImageIndex: 0,
     // array of the source links to the images, simple placeholders for now
        images: [
            'https://via.placeholder.com/200x150?text=first',
            'https://via.placeholder.com/200x150?text=second',
            'https://via.placeholder.com/200x150?text=third',
            'https://via.placeholder.com/200x150?text=fourth',
            'https://via.placeholder.com/200x150?text=fifth',
            'https://via.placeholder.com/200x150?text=sixth',
            'https://via.placeholder.com/200x150?text=seventh',
            'https://via.placeholder.com/200x150?text=eighth',
            'https://via.placeholder.com/200x150?text=ninth',
            'https://via.placeholder.com/200x150?text=tenth'
        ],
     // imported images of right and left arrows
    arrowNext: arrowRight,
    arrowPrev: arrowLeft
 };
...

```

Above I show the data structure assigned to the state of the `<Videos />` component. To change the stateâ€Šâ€”â€Šlist videos to the right and to the leftâ€Šâ€”â€ŠI have also bound two methods **prevSlide()** and **nextSlide()**:

```javascript
// Videos.js

 ...
constructor() {
 ...
    this.nextSlide = this.nextSlide.bind(this);
    this.prevSlide = this.prevSlide.bind(this);
 }
prevSlide() {
 // find the index of the last image in the array
 const lastIndex = this.state.images.length - 1;
 // check if we need to start over from the last index again
 const resetIndex = this.state.currentImageIndex === 0;
 const index = resetIndex ? lastIndex : this.state.currentImageIndex - 1;
// assign the logical index to currentImageIndex that will use in render method
    this.setState({
         currentImageIndex: index
    })
}
nextSlide() {
 // find the index of the last image in the array
 const lastIndex = this.state.images.length - 1;
 // check if we need to start over from the first index
 const resetIndex = this.state.currentImageIndex === lastIndex;
 const index = resetIndex ? 0 : this.state.currentImageIndex + 1;
 // assign the logical index to currentImageIndex that will use in render method
   this.setState({
       currentImageIndex: index
   });
}
```

The logic isnâ€™t complete yet. According to the project requirements the user has to see only 5 videos in the carousel and be able to cycle them over. So, moving on to the **render()** method I have to get a new array of 5 videos in the preview list. Inside the **render()**:

```javascript
// Videos.js
...
render() {
 // get current image index
 const index = this.state.currentImageIndex;
 // create a new array with 5 videos from the source images
 let firstFiveVideo = this.state.images.slice(index, index + 5);
 // check the length of the new array (itâ€™s less than 5 when index is near the end of the array)
 if (firstFiveVideo.length < 5) {
 // if the firstFiveVideo's length is lower than 5 images than append missing images from the beginning of the original array
   firstFiveVideo = firstFiveVideo.concat(this.state.images.slice(0, 5 - firstFiveVideo.length))
 }
return (
   <div>
    // render the left arrow
    <img src={this.state.arrowPrev} onClick={this.prevSlide}/>
    // render images
    {firstFiveVideo.map((image, index) =>
       <img key={index} src={image} alt=""/>
    )}
    // render the right arrow
    <img src={this.state.arrowNext} onClick={this.nextSlide}/>
   </div>
  );
}
```

And thatâ€™s it. Below you will find the screenshot of my implementation:

As I mentioned before, I omitted the styles used for the components, because it was not the purpose of the post. So, it means you are free to apply your own styles to the project ðŸ™‚

Thank you for reading!
