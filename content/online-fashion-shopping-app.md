<h3>1. Overview</h3>
<p>Talking about e-commerce shopping, it's vital to understand that selling the products once via the website or mobile app is only the minimal course of action for the user. What business really aims for is having the user buying via that website or app again and again. The goal is that people would like to use the e-commerce platform and buy items offered on it. Many customers prefer doing shopping online because it's faster, more comfortable and more convenient. iLookStore is the mobile app for fashion shopping that helps users quickly and easily shop and purchase clothing items online, and then have them delivered promptly at little to no cost.</p>
<h3>2. Process</h3>
<p>To put together the vision of the shopping app I have created a list of tasks I could choose from depending on what stage of a project they should be implemented. I decided to have clean and straightforward color palette and layouts. Also, I have built a user flow chart that contains listings of the available products, category links, etc.</p>

<h3>3. Research & Personas</h3>
<p>To figure out which customers to target with the online fashion shopping app, I did user research. As results, I have determined that busy young professionals make up a significant portion of the app's target market.</p>
<p>What is expected business outcome?</p>
<ul>
<li>Expanding customers base and market share</li>
<li>Delivering the products/items to other cities around the country and abroad</li>
<li>Being competitive on the fashion market in online ordering and deliveries of products</li>
</ul>
<p>What are the user's goals?</p>
<ul>
<li>Shopping quickly and easily without spending extra time on it - purchase online</li>
<li>Getting ordered items delivered promptly</li>
</ul>
