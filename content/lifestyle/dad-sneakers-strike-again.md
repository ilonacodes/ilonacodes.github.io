Summer is over,  but not the trend from the spring/summer 2018 - Dad-Sneakers  - oversize sneakers with sick soles paired with the tube socks over jeans. Come back to 80's for that chunky look:

In August 2017 Adidas released Wave Runner 700 collection with the thick-soled design such as Nike introduced the new Mars Yard model at the same time. Later luxury designer labels like Balenciaga, inspired by sportswear labels, caught the hype and created the high-end dad-sneaker versions:

The average price from the luxury fashion houses like Gucci, Louis Vuitton is between $600-$1000 for the battered logo-sided pair of shoes.

Despite "retro" and "heavy" design, the new trend has been successful and accepted by the millennials - the generation that strongly supports equality, duality, showing multiple sides of themselves and unisex appeal.

Not to hang behind, I also decided to invest in a new pair of the trendy shoes. My choice is **Fila Disruptor S Low Chateau Gray**:

More details about the shoes you will find [here](https://www.onygo.com/schuhe/disruptor-s-low-chateau-gray/prod-0001570163284600000004?adword=google/shopping/de/css).

These are exactly what I hoped for. The soles are very thick and cushiony, excellent bulk to them, moreover they are very lightweight and especially useful if you have a wide foot. The stitching and accents all look great. The fit (EU - 38.5) is perfect as I have come to expect from Fila. These will be my regular weekend shoes from now on. Comfortable. Well made. Great looking.

I hope you enjoy my short review for dad-sneaker shoes. If you have something to add to the post and be a co-author. Just contact me per [email](mailto:ilona@ilonacodes.com), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ilonacodes) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ilonacodes/).
