The older I am becoming, the pickier I am about choosing the everyday diet. I do love food, but only healthy and tasty. You do too, don't you?

Unfortunately, everyone has these cheat days (holidays, "shitty mood" days, etc.), when we are just seeking for some unhealthy products, it's okay, we all are humans, and I find it reasonable. The situation is worse if you have not days, but weeks or months...

If you have been overeating junk food, drinking unhealthy drinks for the past few months, perhaps you feel you are: bloated, tired, depressed and in desperate need of detox - to clean out the body of toxic substances and boost metabolism.

Below I listed my five simple everyday detox rules, that I am trying to keep up with:

**Rule #1: Get 7-9 hours of sleep every night**

Sleep has been connected to reduced stress, weight loss, improved overall health. Giving yourself a good night's rest is one of the best ways to detox your body and reset it.

**Rule #2: Maintain your water balance of the body**

Drink a big glass of water right after you wake up and before you go to sleep, and throughout the day as well. By providing your body with hydration upon waking, it refreshes and energizes your cells.

**Rule #3: Speed up your metabolism**

Ensure your water has some fresh lemon slice/drops in it; or brew a pot of ginger tea. That will encourage your digestion.

**Rule #4: Take lots of stretch breaks**

This will decrease fatigue, get your blood flowing through the muscles and get your heart rate up which in turn will burn your calories.

**Rule #5: Avoid alcohol**

Our bodies will work to metabolize the alcohol before any other sources of energy. That means that any food you ate recently will be directly stored as fat because the calories from the alcohol will be used up first, and it has a lot of them. Alcohol is a toxin, and it dehydrates your skin. The best option is to remove it from your life.

That's it.

And don't forget, as long as you are mindful about your health and nutrition, you will keep going in the right direction happily.
