I do believe in positive thinking to maintain my everyday happiness. For sure, no one can stay positive all the time, and it serves no purpose only to be happy.

Positive thinking is directly linked to optimism, mental health, physical health, and leads to a more prosperous and fulfilled life.

We cannot live our future now. Instead, we can convert our current endeavors into our bright future: acting now full of our energy without fear and hope. As Steve Jobs said, "You can connect your dots later in life."

All in all, positive thinking is the result of building good habits. So, below I have shared my four ways to keep staying on the positive side of life. Let's take a look at them one by one:

- **Be grateful for what you have**

Always make it a habit to be thankful for what you have. This will negate any negative thoughts you have. But do not give up on what you have not attained. Go for it, with a positive mindset and that is possible only if you are grateful.

- **Take care of your health**

An unhealthy body cannot be the home of a happy mind. It is vital that you understand the strong link between physical health and mental happiness. So always make sure you take care of your body and mind. If you are fit and healthy, you are likely to have and emit positive energy.

- **Work more for yourself**

In this case, you begin to feel two significant things: you are getting control in your life, and you are doing something with your life.

The combination of these two consequences creates a genuine belief that you have control over your life and are using this control to do something wondrous.

Work more and improve yourself right now. Not for anyone else but yourself. You will feel 100% better at the end of the day.

- **Trust yourself**

Believe that you can figure out everything that happens and start to step out of your comfort zone to prove it to yourself.

Do as many things as possible that scare you, that will push you to be a more excellent person and you will not even find a reason anymore to think negatively.

It took a while for me too, to adopt these approaches in my life. You are not the first one, and definitely not the last one on this way to happiness and success.

Thank you for reading!
