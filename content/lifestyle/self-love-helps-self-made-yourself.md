I thought a lot whether I should start blogging about my lifestyle or not. After all the pros and cons, now you are reading my first post, and I happily welcome you here!

<!--more-->

I will publish regularly. This lifestyle blog is based on my own experiences and views (I also have [tech blog](/blog/) where I talk about frontend).

If I look back at my background, origin mentality, and self-esteem I can’t tell I’ll be living in Berlin, pursuing M.Sc and working as a programmer. The most important lesson that I have learned in the last three years is that all life changes start in your head.

In my case, with **self-love**.

Earlier I didn't care that much about my appearance, didn't learn from my mistakes, and that impacted negatively on my life, and led to mental health problems.

Why? Because I didn't love myself, didn't think that I deserve more than I have and should keep working to achieve more - fulfill my ambitions - make myself in the way as I always wanted to be.

Self-love is not as easy as it seems.

In the beginning, I was guilty of being too hard on myself. That happened because I have expected perfection from myself in whatever I chose to do (like learning foreign languages). And that added a ton of pressure to the way I live daily.

I was so hard on myself physically, mentally, and professionally. I burned out my self at the end.

It was an unproductive way to live!

Thankfully though, I had caught myself before it became a habit and started my self-love journey.

I have decided to:

- take responsibility for my life, push myself to grow and achieve my full potential, set the goals and reach them,
- respect my body and give it the right nurturing, care, rest, and exercise in the way I enjoy,
- believe in karma — I wish all the best to all people,
- review my garderobe and dress in clothes that make me feel good and beautiful in my eyes at first,
- build a life without relying on others for happiness.

Going through all my decisions, and I see the positive results and feel how I have never felt before.

I am happy, good looking, confident, mentally and physically healthy, proud of myself and full of energy to move forward and achieve my goals, and fulfill my dreams.

There are times when the self-doubt will plague us.

Rather than hiding our so-called imperfections, let’s transform them in other cheerleaders for self-love.

Cheers, <br>
