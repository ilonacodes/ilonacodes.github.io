      <description>The last week I have attended Ada Lovelace Festival that occurred on 19-20 October 2017. The aim of the event to connect women in computing and technology.
Unfortunately, I was a bit too late for the keynote, because I had a lecture at the university. However, I joined the conference, and after registration, I got my bag with sponsors gifts.
For example, a pen and a paper notebook from the WirtschaftsWoche, and a small car model and candies from Porsche.</description>

      <description>Hi, everyone!
As you noticed, I post a new blog post about the development of an interactive ToDo list regularly, every five days. But today I am going to tell you about the international IT-conference Codemotion, that I have attended on 12-13. October in Berlin.
There were a lot of informative and motivational topics, that can inspire everyone, who are interested or work in IT-branch.
All talks occurred in four different spaces and referred by the topic of the sessions.</description>
