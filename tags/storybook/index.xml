      <description>Hey there, thatâ€™s me again and a new post from me!
Lately, I worked on the project that generates live documentation of the front-end components for apps built with create-react-app, and this UI development environment is called Storybook.
What is the significant purpose for using this tool?
First of all, it helps to avoid code duplications and to make it easy to know which components there are already, what they are doing and how they are being used.</description>
