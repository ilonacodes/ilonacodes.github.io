There are a lot of different and efficient ways how to improve web app development speed while implementing and testing new features. One of them is to be able to reuse UI components.&lt;/p&gt;

There are many tools available for designers to create beautiful user interfaces and user experiences. And today I want to share another approach on how to build interactive design prototypes with ReactJS and why.&lt;/p&gt;

In this post, I explain how you can find any user on GitHub through GitHub API using ReactJS, Redux, Saga, Axios, and Formik.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do we need to use this technology stack? Here is the short description:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Avoid Duplication of Common Wrapper Behavior in React Using Children Prop</title>

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When I was learning React there were a couple things that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t clearly understand and one of them was &lt;strong&gt;children prop&lt;/strong&gt;. That is until I faced the problem similar to the following one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we are! Due to my master thesis at the university, one of the requirements is the implementation of an interactive mockup for the university WebTV platform. So, I decided to make it with React.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The last days I am working on the project, which should include the state machine. Implementing this project with React, I decided to use the Redux framework to manage state in my React application. Moreover, thanks to redux store we can debug data (in one place) easily.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Formik With React</title>

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

The way, how I try to understand the purpose of any framework is to use it and compare with the already implemented no-framework solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, most of us, at first hear about a new library from tech media portals or from tech-dev influencers or from conferences/meetups or from coworkers, etc. then we are going to check out the source of it whether it is a software or open-source product. In the end, we are playing with it and trying to apply it to the existing product.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Hi everyone! It&amp;rsquo;s time for a new post.
What we do (I mean front-end web developers) isn&amp;rsquo;t all that unique. Often we face the problem that seems easy to solve. However, sometimes we spend hours on finding the solution.
In this case, I wanted to change the opacity of the app teaser background color and don&amp;rsquo;t change the opacity of links. I have tried some silly approaches that seemed logical to me, and they all have failed.</description>

      <description>Happy Friday, my readers!
As a front-end web developer, I am also interested in UI/UX design, and that is why I’ve decided me to do a UI/UX research using Aristotle’s Seven Elements of Storytelling framework.
It is notably practical, and many designers, web developers, will benefit from applying this method for creating user-friendly interfaces.
In my opinion, it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand the users and to make it easier for them to use apps.</description>

      <description>Hey there, that’s me again and a new post from me!
Lately, I worked on the project that generates live documentation of the front-end components for apps built with create-react-app, and this UI development environment is called Storybook.
What is the significant purpose for using this tool?
First of all, it helps to avoid code duplications and to make it easy to know which components there are already, what they are doing and how they are being used.</description>

      <description>Hi, everyone! How is your weekend going?
As you know, I prefer learning to code by doing things. So, the last feature I have implemented for the app is the reading of the content from the uploaded (local) .csv file from the user.
To do so without a server or any back-end—is a challenge.
To make things work properly in React+Redux, I have created the following component:
const ImportFromFileBodyComponent = () =&amp;gt; { let fileReader; const handleFileRead = (e) =&amp;gt; { const content = fileReader.</description>

      <description>There are many possibilities how to remove multiple items from the array with JavaScript. So in this tutorial, I am going to share my approach to delete function with React+Redux.
It&amp;rsquo;s front-end shorts, and I am trying to highlight the most important information. Thus, just let’s have a look at the significant code snippets with explanations:
I have created the action:
// expenseActions.js export const t = { ... DELETE_EXPENSE: &#39;DELETE_EXPENSE&#39;, .</description>

      <description>Today I am going to tell you how to get JSON data from the Rest-API to UI using React+Redux frameworks.
In my case, the task looks like:
I have a URL, for example: https://api.com/v1/expenses/ which will give the following JSON data, and I want to get this data in my UI.
To solve this task, I decided to use JavaScript’s fetch method. So in this way, I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t rely on any external libraries (given my target browsers are remotely up-to-date).</description>

      <description>Hi, everyone! How is your week going?
Yesterday I worked with the web application written on React + Redux and had had some problem with the react-router-redux library. In short, the push method (using for navigation outside of components) didn&amp;rsquo;t work.
Firstly, I have tried to set the Route component in the &amp;ldquo;traditional&amp;rdquo; way such as with react-router library. That might get the history props. Unfortunately, that also didn&amp;rsquo;t work. Because of Redux framework.</description>

      <description>Hi, there! I hope you enjoy your weekend, and ready for a new post.
Recently there are a lot of sites, which have featured with parallax scrolling effect, that represents them in more interactive &amp;ldquo;professionally-made&amp;rdquo; way.
This fact made me recreate the effect using Vanilla JavaScript, an example of which you can see below.
Let&amp;rsquo;s a look at the implementation of parallax effect in Vanilla JavaScript.
I have used a &amp;lsquo;scroll&amp;rsquo; event on browser &amp;lsquo;window,&amp;rsquo; and retrieved the number of pixels the document is currently scrolled along the vertical axis from &amp;lsquo;window.</description>

The last days I had to work with Javascript and jQuery a lot apart from React and spent much time on creating templates. As you know, nowadays modern web pages include animated scrolling, which makes any site look professional and more elegant (instead of simple link element reference in HTML5).</description>

      <description>Hi there!
I have worked on my project using a React-Redux architecture with React-Router for navigation. I have implemented forms for adding and editing resources. I have observed weird behavior:
 Add new resource with a description: &amp;ldquo;Hello World!&amp;rdquo; Start editing another resource with a description: &amp;ldquo;My new comment&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; Input for description contains a previous value: &amp;ldquo;Hello World!&amp;rdquo;  I was expecting to see the current description of the resource: &amp;ldquo;My new comment&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;, not the value from the previous form.</description>
