      <description>The last week I have attended Ada Lovelace Festival that occurred on 19-20 October 2017. The aim of the event to connect women in computing and technology.
Unfortunately, I was a bit too late for the keynote, because I had a lecture at the university. However, I joined the conference, and after registration, I got my bag with sponsors gifts.
For example, a pen and a paper notebook from the WirtschaftsWoche, and a small car model and candies from Porsche.</description>
