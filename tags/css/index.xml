      <description>Hi there!
There are a lot of ways how to implement a sticky footer on the page that will always remain at a fixed position on the screen no matter whether the user scroll or not. It will be visible all the time at that specific place (often on bottom).
I would like to share my way how I added the sticky footer on my site.
Firstly, I added two separated  tags inside the body in index.</description>

      <description>Hi, everyone!
I am very happy to welcome you on my blog. A couple of days ago I started creating my new project (that I will have presented to you in a couple of weeks). And I have faced the following problem: I wanted to build a page with Sign Up form, and this page doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any other content. In that case, it made a lot of sense to center the form, both horizontally and vertically.</description>
