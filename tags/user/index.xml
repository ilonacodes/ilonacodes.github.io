      <description>Hi there! I am so happy that you continue developing our interactive Daily ToDo app with me. Today you are going to get to know how to implement a dynamic progress bar that will handle task completing status by percentage for every category.
But before moving on, if you are new here, please, have a look at the previous posts. You should start developing app there and then continue with us here.</description>

      <description>The most valuable feature set for our Daily ToDo is already done. Today we are going to make an app more functional, separating tasks by categories. We want to be able to categorize task by typing # and category after its title.
For example: practice a coding kata #programming.
As always, we start with the simple user story and the acceptance criteria:
As Bob I want to categorize tasks by adding tag into input So I see which task belongs to which category ## Acceptance Criteria Given there are no tasks And I am on dashboard screen When I finish inputting a new task title And choose the category (tag) for a task And press Enter Then I see the categorized task by tag on the dashboard screen Tag examples: Programming, Sport, Languages, University, Reading, Routine  If you are a new reader of the tutorial series and don&amp;rsquo;t understand what is going on at the moment, then just check the previous posts starting with React For Very Very Beginners</description>

      <description>Hi, everyone! I guess you are pretty encouraged to start coding our app. Just to remind: it will be an interactive daily ToDo List. Today I am going to explain: what is a user story? Why do we need to write it before implementing a feature? How will we organize and structure an app? What is, actually, a new feature?
Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the first question. In my opinion, user stories are efficient things.</description>
