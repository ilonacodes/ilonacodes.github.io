      <title>React.js &amp; React Native Meetup at Home24 in Berlin</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey, there! In this blog post, I’m going to share my impression about the React.js &amp;amp; React Native meetup in Berlin that I have visited at Home24 yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you still didn&amp;rsquo;t have a look at the topic of my blog, so, as you noticed from the title, I am interested in front-end development and at the moments specialized in the JavaScript language and especially in React framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Close to the point, I would like to tell you a couple of words about the last meetup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, there were three talks, breaks, pizza+bier, and, definitely, the opportunity for networking and communicating with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I’m going to tell you about the talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ilonacodes.github.io/blog/images/react-meetup-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Photo-1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first speaker, Shahjada Talukdar, Frontend Engineer at Perdoo presented &lt;code&gt;Build your dream app with CRA (Create React App)&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to build a simple app with Create React App (CRA) using the simple command &lt;code&gt;create-react-app name&lt;/code&gt; in the terminal;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to start/build/eject with &lt;a href=&#34;https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/&#34;&gt;yarn&lt;/a&gt; that serving local and on network;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why we should be using &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/?hl=en&#34;&gt;service worker&lt;/a&gt; that controls what happens on a request-by-request basis and also allows React apps working offline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ilonacodes.github.io/blog/images/react-meetup-2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Photo-2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second talk called &lt;code&gt;React SSR featuring AWS Lambda&lt;/code&gt; by George Lolos, Frontend Squad Leader at Home24 AG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk is about how to improve the performance, how to structure React app and how to solve small problems in front-end part. They’ve also told us about React SSR (Server Side Rendering).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React SSR renders basic pages, and AWS Lambda runs code without managing servers. And the biggest challenge was the massive size of Lambda. So, the speaker shared with us approaches how to minify it and the result that they have achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ilonacodes.github.io/blog/images/react-meetup-3.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Photo-3&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, the third talk &lt;code&gt;Beyond JavaScript: The Hidden Benefit of React Native&lt;/code&gt; by Wojciech Ogrodowczyk, Partner at Brains &amp;amp; Beards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The talk refers to choosing an optimal programming language to optimize and to improve the performance of the code. The speaker also mentioned an approach how to solve the language problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, by dividing the team into groups. Then every group should decide which programming language they will choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then they will implement a small project during the next couple of months. In the end, they will compare the performance of every group relative to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t forget that in computer science everything depends on team skills, personality, and other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ilonacodes.github.io/blog/images/react-meetup-4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Photo-4&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have shared my thoughts and opinions above on how I understood the topics of the talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are located close to where React.js &amp;amp; React Native community meets and interested in front-end, then I highly recommend you to visit such meetings and get to learn more about it from competent people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for the reading! Have a nice week!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What Did I Learn at Codemotion Berlin 2017</title>

&lt;p&gt;Hi, everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you noticed, I post a new blog post about the development of an interactive ToDo list regularly, every five days. But today I am going to tell you about the international IT-conference &lt;a href=&#34;https://berlin2017.codemotionworld.com/&#34;&gt;Codemotion&lt;/a&gt;, that I have attended on 12-13. October in Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ilonacodes.github.io/blog/images/codemotion.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;Codemotion&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were a lot of informative and motivational topics, that can inspire everyone, who are interested or work in IT-branch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All talks occurred in four different spaces and referred by the topic of the sessions. For example, in &lt;code&gt;Maschinenhaus&lt;/code&gt; speakers gave a speech mostly about technologies and practical approaches that they use. In &lt;code&gt;Community Stage&lt;/code&gt; the talks were related to motivational topics, discussing programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, there took place &lt;code&gt;Ruby on Rails Workshop&lt;/code&gt;. The full agenda of the conference you can check below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ilonacodes.github.io/blog/images/agenda-12-10.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Agenda-1&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://ilonacodes.github.io/blog/images/agenda-13-10.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Agenda-2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most interesting talks for me as a frontend developer, I included to &lt;code&gt;My Favorites&lt;/code&gt; list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to share more information about them with you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;frontend-frameworkless-development-by-francesco-strazzullo-exstrategy&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Frontend Frameworkless Development&lt;/code&gt; by Francesco Strazzullo | exstrategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ilonacodes.github.io/blog/images/speaker-1.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;Speaker-1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea of the talk based on the possibility to develop new apps, new features for apps while not using any frameworks. The example code, the empty forms, are written in &lt;code&gt;Vanilla JavaScript&lt;/code&gt; replacing &lt;code&gt;React+Redux&lt;/code&gt; frameworks for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the speaker showed us that there is no dependency in &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; (the file that includes all dependencies and configures the project).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then they have implemented the function that is similar to ReactDOM rendering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, they have replaced Redux features by creating variables &lt;code&gt;store&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;state&lt;/code&gt;. They handle the current and calculation of the new state. Finally, they store new state back to &lt;code&gt;store&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s possible to write clean code without using any frameworks. Vanilla JavaScript still will be alive for the next tens of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frameworks might die the following year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am an introvert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, I have found this talk extremely useful for me. It is on how to improve my soft skills by speaking not only in front of the people but also with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slide on the photo below describes some “icebreakers” that allow starting, keeping, and controlling a conversation in life, and on the stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;build-bridges-not-walls-design-for-users-across-cultures-by-jenny-shen-toptal&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Build bridges, not walls - Design for users across cultures&lt;/code&gt; by Jenny Shen | Toptal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was lucky to meet and speak personally with the speaker &lt;a href=&#34;http://jennyshen.com/&#34;&gt;Jenny Shen&lt;/a&gt;. They have worked in five countries before and currently are based in Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using illustrative examples, Jenny showed us how important it is to know the culture of society you are developing for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What kinds of problems can appear in design? Which data should be taken into account to make people of different cultures happy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have already moved to another country once. I can relate to that so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of my development projects are for multicultural users. I think it is necessary to know most common obstacles that I could meet on my &amp;ldquo;development&amp;rdquo; path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://ilonacodes.github.io/blog/images/speaker-3.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;Speaker-3&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://codemotionworld.com/&#34;&gt;Codemotion&lt;/a&gt; conferences are worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are suitable for any professional level of IT-people with different backgrounds. That helps to get to know more about IT-world at its current state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is fantastic to participate in workshops, and network with amazing people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be glad to answer any questions about my impression. Feel free to give any feedback for this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find me on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/ilonacodes/&#34;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; or send me a private letter on my &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:demiluri@gmail.com&#34;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;
