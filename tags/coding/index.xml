      <description>Hi everyone! It&amp;rsquo;s time for a new post.
What we do (I mean front-end web developers) isn&amp;rsquo;t all that unique. Often we face the problem that seems easy to solve. However, sometimes we spend hours on finding the solution.
In this case, I wanted to change the opacity of the app teaser background color and don&amp;rsquo;t change the opacity of links. I have tried some silly approaches that seemed logical to me, and they all have failed.</description>

      <title>Front-end Shorts: Good Storytelling Elements</title>

      <description>Happy Friday, my readers!
As a front-end web developer, I am also interested in UI/UX design, and that is why Iâ€™ve decided me to do a UI/UX research using Aristotleâ€™s Seven Elements of Storytelling framework.
It is notably practical, and many designers, web developers, will benefit from applying this method for creating user-friendly interfaces.
In my opinion, it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand the users and to make it easier for them to use apps.</description>

      <description>Hey there, thatâ€™s me again and a new post from me!
Lately, I worked on the project that generates live documentation of the front-end components for apps built with create-react-app, and this UI development environment is called Storybook.
What is the significant purpose for using this tool?
First of all, it helps to avoid code duplications and to make it easy to know which components there are already, what they are doing and how they are being used.</description>

      <description>Hi, everyone! How is your weekend going?
As you know, I prefer learning to code by doing things. So, the last feature I have implemented for the app is the reading of the content from the uploaded (local) .csv file from the user.
To do so without a server or any back-endâ€”is a challenge.
To make things work properly in React+Redux, I have created the following component:
const ImportFromFileBodyComponent = () =&amp;gt; { let fileReader; const handleFileRead = (e) =&amp;gt; { const content = fileReader.</description>

      <description>There are many possibilities how to remove multiple items from the array with JavaScript. So in this tutorial, I am going to share my approach to delete function with React+Redux.
It&amp;rsquo;s front-end shorts, and I am trying to highlight the most important information. Thus, just letâ€™s have a look at the significant code snippets with explanations:
I have created the action:
// expenseActions.js  export const t = { ... DELETE_EXPENSE: &amp;#39;DELETE_EXPENSE&amp;#39;, .</description>

      <description>Today I am going to tell you how to get JSON data from the Rest-API to UI using React+Redux frameworks.
In my case, the task looks like:
I have a URL, for example: https://api.com/v1/expenses/ which will give the following JSON data, and I want to get this data in my UI.
To solve this task, I decided to use JavaScriptâ€™s fetch method. So in this way, I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t rely on any external libraries (given my target browsers are remotely up-to-date).</description>

      <description>Hi, everyone! How is your week going?
Yesterday I worked with the web application written on React + Redux and had had some problem with the react-router-redux library. In short, the push method (using for navigation outside of components) didn&amp;rsquo;t work.
Firstly, I have tried to set the Route component in the &amp;ldquo;traditional&amp;rdquo; way such as with react-router library. That might get the history props. Unfortunately, that also didn&amp;rsquo;t work. Because of Redux framework.</description>

      <description>Hi, there! I hope you enjoy your weekend, and ready for a new post.
Recently there are a lot of sites, which have featured with parallax scrolling effect, that represents them in more interactive &amp;ldquo;professionally-made&amp;rdquo; way.
This fact made me recreate the effect using Vanilla JavaScript, an example of which you can see below.
Let&amp;rsquo;s a look at the implementation of parallax effect in Vanilla JavaScript.
I have used a &amp;lsquo;scroll&amp;rsquo; event on browser &amp;lsquo;window,&amp;rsquo; and retrieved the number of pixels the document is currently scrolled along the vertical axis from &amp;lsquo;window.</description>

      <description>Here I am back and decided to continue blogging with front-end shorts. Unfortunately, I don&amp;rsquo;t have enough time to write big posts, but I would be happy to share some frontend tips and tricks that I have already applied for some of my projects.
The last days I had to work with Javascript and jQuery a lot apart from React and spent much time on creating templates. As you know, nowadays modern web pages include animated scrolling, which makes any site look professional and more elegant (instead of simple link element reference in HTML5).</description>

      <description>The last week I have attended Ada Lovelace Festival that occurred on 19-20 October 2017. The aim of the event to connect women in computing and technology.
Unfortunately, I was a bit too late for the keynote, because I had a lecture at the university. However, I joined the conference, and after registration, I got my bag with sponsors gifts.
For example, a pen and a paper notebook from the WirtschaftsWoche, and a small car model and candies from Porsche.</description>

      <description>Hey, there! In this blog post, Iâ€™m going to share my impression about the React.js &amp;amp; React Native meetup in Berlin that I have visited at Home24 yesterday.
If you still didn&amp;rsquo;t have a look at the topic of my blog, so, as you noticed from the title, I am interested in front-end development and at the moments specialized in the JavaScript language and especially in React framework.
Close to the point, I would like to tell you a couple of words about the last meetup.</description>

      <description>Hi, everyone!
As you noticed, I post a new blog post about the development of an interactive ToDo list regularly, every five days. But today I am going to tell you about the international IT-conference Codemotion, that I have attended on 12-13. October in Berlin.
There were a lot of informative and motivational topics, that can inspire everyone, who are interested or work in IT-branch.
All talks occurred in four different spaces and referred by the topic of the sessions.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s continue developing an Interactive ToDo List. Refer to the previous posts you notice that we are almost done with the basic functionality of the application. And today I would like to start the topic about persisting the data and restoring it after refreshing the page or starting a new session on the local machine with React+Redux.
Changing into the my-daily-todos project, then to src folder where you find index.js. Here we store all the appâ€™s state in the store variable.</description>

      <description>Hi there! I am so happy that you continue developing our interactive Daily ToDo app with me. Today you are going to get to know how to implement a dynamic progress bar that will handle task completing status by percentage for every category.
But before moving on, if you are new here, please, have a look at the previous posts. You should start developing app there and then continue with us here.</description>

      <description>The most valuable feature set for our Daily ToDo is already done. Today we are going to make an app more functional, separating tasks by categories. We want to be able to categorize task by typing # and category after its title.
For example: practice a coding kata #programming.
As always, we start with the simple user story and the acceptance criteria:
As Bob I want to categorize tasks by adding tag into input So I see which task belongs to which category ## Acceptance Criteria Given there are no tasks And I am on dashboard screen When I finish inputting a new task title And choose the category (tag) for a task And press Enter Then I see the categorized task by tag on the dashboard screen Tag examples: Programming, Sport, Languages, University, Reading, Routine If you are a new reader of the tutorial series and don&amp;rsquo;t understand what is going on at the moment, then just check the previous posts starting with React For Very Very Beginners</description>

      <description>Today we are going to implement the second feature for our app. If you are a new reader, then I highly recommend you to check my earlier blog posts here, where we started our learning journey in React+Redux, refer to the posts complete previous steps and continue with us to develop an interactive ToDo List from here.
As you guess from the blog title, the next feature called Complete a task.</description>

      <description>Hi, everyone! I guess you are pretty encouraged to start coding our app. Just to remind: it will be an interactive daily ToDo List. Today I am going to explain: what is a user story? Why do we need to write it before implementing a feature? How will we organize and structure an app? What is, actually, a new feature?
Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the first question. In my opinion, user stories are efficient things.</description>

      <description>As I promised in my previous post, today I am going to tell you about Redux, why and how we need to use them in common. Let me introduce React+Redux co-working through the simple input change that should render Hello, {any name / text}! at the end and manage by redux states.
Redux? What is it? Redux is a predictable state container for managing both UI-state and data-state in JavaScript applications.</description>

      <description>The biggest challenge for beginners not only in front end development but also in the whole web development world is to find the answer to the question: How / Where should I start to learn web development? Some of these questions I have already received via private messages on social networks, and that encouraged me to create a series of small posts to write and complete the first app using JS (ECMA6) with React-Redux frameworks on which technologies I specialize.</description>
