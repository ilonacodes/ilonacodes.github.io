&lt;p&gt;To understand the business goals is just as important as understanding user needs. Without that, the chances of creating useful and viable products are low. Here is why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From the title, you already guessed that I am going to speak about the design of the product, app or website that starts with content first.
In my opinion, there are many advantages to applying the content first approach.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>1. Overview Considering so many women now use beauty treatment services it seems worth to implement the app that allows managing appointments for beauty care procedures by categories. Choose a date, create a new beauty appointment relevant to the beauty category, and you will not be confused anymore with the uncategorized beauty appointment list.
2. Process On the top place, the product strategy took into account to create MVP model with the primary feature set I was working on.</description>

      <description>1. Overview Talking about e-commerce shopping, it&amp;rsquo;s vital to understand that selling the products once via the website or mobile app is only the minimal course of action for the user. What business really aims for is having the user buying via that website or app again and again. The goal is that people would like to use the e-commerce platform and buy items offered on it. Many customers prefer doing shopping online because it&amp;rsquo;s faster, more comfortable and more convenient.</description>

&lt;p&gt;If you really want to get better at color, start studying it.
Picking the right colors is something that might seem easy at first. And when you are starting down a color wheel, you are going to wish you had some information on what you are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Hi everyone! It&amp;rsquo;s time for a new post.
What we do (I mean front-end web developers) isn&amp;rsquo;t all that unique. Often we face the problem that seems easy to solve. However, sometimes we spend hours on finding the solution.
In this case, I wanted to change the opacity of the app teaser background color and don&amp;rsquo;t change the opacity of links. I have tried some silly approaches that seemed logical to me, and they all have failed.</description>

      <description>Happy Friday, my readers!
As a front-end web developer, I am also interested in UI/UX design, and that is why I’ve decided me to do a UI/UX research using Aristotle’s Seven Elements of Storytelling framework.
It is notably practical, and many designers, web developers, will benefit from applying this method for creating user-friendly interfaces.
In my opinion, it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand the users and to make it easier for them to use apps.</description>

      <description>Hey there, that’s me again and a new post from me!
Lately, I worked on the project that generates live documentation of the front-end components for apps built with create-react-app, and this UI development environment is called Storybook.
What is the significant purpose for using this tool?
First of all, it helps to avoid code duplications and to make it easy to know which components there are already, what they are doing and how they are being used.</description>

      <description>Hi, everyone! How is your weekend going?
As you know, I prefer learning to code by doing things. So, the last feature I have implemented for the app is the reading of the content from the uploaded (local) .csv file from the user.
To do so without a server or any back-end—is a challenge.
To make things work properly in React+Redux, I have created the following component:
const ImportFromFileBodyComponent = () =&amp;gt; { let fileReader; const handleFileRead = (e) =&amp;gt; { const content = fileReader.</description>

      <description>There are many possibilities how to remove multiple items from the array with JavaScript. So in this tutorial, I am going to share my approach to delete function with React+Redux.
It&amp;rsquo;s front-end shorts, and I am trying to highlight the most important information. Thus, just let’s have a look at the significant code snippets with explanations:
I have created the action:

      <description>Today I am going to tell you how to get JSON data from the Rest-API to UI using React+Redux frameworks.
In my case, the task looks like:
I have a URL, for example: https://api.com/v1/expenses/ which will give the following JSON data, and I want to get this data in my UI.
To solve this task, I decided to use JavaScript’s fetch method. So in this way, I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t rely on any external libraries (given my target browsers are remotely up-to-date).</description>

      <description>Hi, everyone! How is your week going?
Yesterday I worked with the web application written on React + Redux and had had some problem with the react-router-redux library. In short, the push method (using for navigation outside of components) didn&amp;rsquo;t work.
Firstly, I have tried to set the Route component in the &amp;ldquo;traditional&amp;rdquo; way such as with react-router library. That might get the history props. Unfortunately, that also didn&amp;rsquo;t work. Because of Redux framework.</description>

      <description>Hi, there! I hope you enjoy your weekend, and ready for a new post.
Recently there are a lot of sites, which have featured with parallax scrolling effect, that represents them in more interactive &amp;ldquo;professionally-made&amp;rdquo; way.
This fact made me recreate the effect using Vanilla JavaScript, an example of which you can see below.
Let&amp;rsquo;s a look at the implementation of parallax effect in Vanilla JavaScript.
I have used a &amp;lsquo;scroll&amp;rsquo; event on browser &amp;lsquo;window,&amp;rsquo; and retrieved the number of pixels the document is currently scrolled along the vertical axis from &amp;lsquo;window.</description>

The last days I had to work with Javascript and jQuery a lot apart from React and spent much time on creating templates. As you know, nowadays modern web pages include animated scrolling, which makes any site look professional and more elegant (instead of simple link element reference in HTML5).</description>

For example, a pen and a paper notebook from the WirtschaftsWoche, and a small car model and candies from Porsche.</description>

And today I would like to start the topic about persisting the data and restoring it after refreshing the page or starting a new session on the local machine with React+Redux.
Changing into the my-daily-todos project, then to src folder where you find index.js. Here we store all the app’s state in the store variable.</description>

      <description>The most valuable feature set for our Daily ToDo is already done. Today we are going to make an app more functional, separating tasks by categories. We want to be able to categorize task by typing # and category after its title.
For example: practice a coding kata #programming.
As always, we start with the simple user story and the acceptance criteria:
As Bob I want to categorize tasks by adding tag into input So I see which task belongs to which category ## Acceptance Criteria Given there are no tasks And I am on dashboard screen When I finish inputting a new task title And choose the category (tag) for a task And press Enter Then I see the categorized task by tag on the dashboard screen Tag examples: Programming, Sport, Languages, University, Reading, Routine  If you are a new reader of the tutorial series and don&amp;rsquo;t understand what is going on at the moment, then just check the previous posts starting with React For Very Very Beginners</description>

      <description>Hi, everyone! I guess you are pretty encouraged to start coding our app. Just to remind: it will be an interactive daily ToDo List. Today I am going to explain: what is a user story? Why do we need to write it before implementing a feature? How will we organize and structure an app? What is, actually, a new feature?
Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the first question. In my opinion, user stories are efficient things.</description>

      <description>As I promised in my previous post, today I am going to tell you about Redux, why and how we need to use them in common. Let me introduce React+Redux co-working through the simple input change that should render Hello, {any name / text}! at the end and manage by redux states.
Redux? What is it? Redux is a predictable state container for managing both UI-state and data-state in JavaScript applications.</description>

      <description>The biggest challenge for beginners not only in front end development but also in the whole web development world is to find the answer to the question: How / Where should I start to learn web development? Some of these questions I have already received via private messages on social networks, and that encouraged me to create a series of small posts to write and complete the first app using JS (ECMA6) with React-Redux frameworks on which technologies I specialize.</description>

      <description>Today I started doing backend part for my project. It will be written in Ruby language and using Sinatra framework.
This post is directed at readers that have little experiences to understand the aim of REST API for a product development.
Coming back to my project, I had to implement search and preview functionalities. I used a .txt file to describe the REST API precisely and go through it step by step.</description>

      <description>Hi there!
There are a lot of ways how to implement a sticky footer on the page that will always remain at a fixed position on the screen no matter whether the user scroll or not. It will be visible all the time at that specific place (often on bottom).
I would like to share my way how I added the sticky footer on my site.
Firstly, I added two separated  tags inside the body in index.</description>

      <description>Hi there!
I have worked on my project using a React-Redux architecture with React-Router for navigation. I have implemented forms for adding and editing resources. I have observed weird behavior:
 Add new resource with a description: &amp;ldquo;Hello World!&amp;rdquo; Start editing another resource with a description: &amp;ldquo;My new comment&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; Input for description contains a previous value: &amp;ldquo;Hello World!&amp;rdquo;  I was expecting to see the current description of the resource: &amp;ldquo;My new comment&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;, not the value from the previous form.</description>

      <description>Hi, everyone!
I am very happy to welcome you on my blog. A couple of days ago I started creating my new project (that I will have presented to you in a couple of weeks). And I have faced the following problem: I wanted to build a page with Sign Up form, and this page doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any other content. In that case, it made a lot of sense to center the form, both horizontally and vertically.</description>
